Mondays are for Full-Stack Development.

Today I continued on with [Front End Masters Complete Intro to Web Development](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/).

While I believe I'm far past the skills or knowledge taught in this course I feel like it's a good refresher. I've been watching the videos at 2x speed and just burning through them, stopping only when I learn something new. Today's takeaway was something simple and I was surprised I'd never come across this. You can call methods directly on a literal. For example:

`“Hello World!”.toLowerCase();`
