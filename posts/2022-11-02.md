Wednesdays are for Data Structures and Algorithms.

Working through [Codecademy’s Pass the Technical Interview with JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-javascript) I studied Heaps today. Heaps are binary trees, represented by an array, that efficiently keep track of the minimum (min-heap) or maximum (max-heap) value in a dataset. To quote Codecademy, “Heaps enable solutions for complex problems such as finding the shortest path (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) or efficiently sorting a dataset (heapsort).”

I got stuck on the concept of ”heapifying” for just a moment because I was reading the code wrong. I wasn’t comparing left and right children to determine what needed to be swapped but the current and left or current and right. Once I wrapped my head around that I think I have a pretty good understanding of the data structure and am ready to implement some of the algorithms it facilitates.
