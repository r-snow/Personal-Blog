Tuesdays are for AWS.

Last week I spent Tuesday studying for, taking, and eventually passing my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. If you’re so inclined you can see said cert [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/5eaefa06-fc0f-4a55-b21c-586206dfb0d8/linked_in_profile).

Since getting my first AWS certification last week I’ve been so excited to practice my new skills. So, to kill two birds with one stone, I went through Next.js’ [learn course](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) tutorial and created this personal blog you’re reading right now. I built an app on Next.js in [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/) but with the help of cohort mates and looming deadlines, my Next.js learning felt like the oft-referred to as “drinking from a fire hose” learning and I wanted a quick refresher. I haven’t spent any effort in styling this blog, it was really just an exercise in Next.js and gave me a static project to practice deploying to an AWS S3. After completing this blog last week, I spent this morning deploying it on an AWS S3 in the Northern California Region with the intention of reducing latency and cost for my own views of the site given that is my nearest AWS Region. If I see increased traffic to the site from other Regions I’ll enable Multi Region Access Points to reduce latency for those viewers as well.

For the rest of the afternoon, it’s “on to the next one” and I’m beginning my studying for my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate Certification exam. Starting with the [AWS Skill Builder: Solutions Architect Learning Plan](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/lp/1044/solutions-architect-learning-plan).
